# IT5015D-Research-Repository

Projects:

The projects I chose to research are games because I want to have some fun playing a different version of these games, especially when I code one all by myself, I'll have a huge feeling of accomplishment completing them.
The games I chose as part of my research includes a number guessing game for the computer or a person to play, Hangman, Three Cup Monte, and my favourite, Wordle.




Do you take regular breaks away from your screen?

Yes I do. I try to get out of my chair every 30 minutes, or an hour if I got extra busy. There are a few different ways I take breaks. One of them is doing high-knees up to my hips, I do this for 3-5 minutes.

Another way I take breaks, usually after doing high-knees is I stand or lie down doing nothing, and I mean nothing. (That means not going on my phone too.) This is called Niksen, which I think is a very powerful way to take breaks and clear your mind. One way I do this is taking a walk on farm land which I live right next to and then find a place to sit for up to half an hour, walk back and get back to work. Sometimes in our lives, we all have moments when we come up with the most creative ideas or find alternative solutions to problems, whether it'd be in the shower, in bed, or being bored waiting for something. This method has had outstanding effects on my learning, and there's nothing like getting back to work with a cleared brain and feeling more motivated to learn.
I believe that if we all do absolutely nothing more often, we can all become better thinkers.
