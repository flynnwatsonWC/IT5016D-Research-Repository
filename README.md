# IT5015D-Research-Repository

Projects:

The projects I chose to research are games because I find it fun playing a 'homemade digital' version of the game, and when I code it all by myself, I'll have a huge feeling of accomplishment completing them.
I chose classic games as part of my research which includes hangman, and my personal favourite, Wordle.




Do you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen?

Yes I do. I try to get out of my chair every 30 minutes, or an hour if I got stuck into my work. There are a few different ways I take breaks. One of them is doing high-knees up to my hips. I make it an intense workout by doing this for 2-3 minutes.

Another way I take breaks, usually after doing high-knees is standing or lying down doing nothing. Yes, nothing. That means not going on my phone too. This is called Niksen, which I think is a very powerful way to clear your mind. One way I do this is taking a walk on farm land which I live right next to. I then find a place to sit for up to half an hour, walk back and get back to work. Sometimes in our lives, we all have moments when we come up with the most creative ideas or solutions, whether it'd be in the shower, in bed, or being bored waiting for something. 
This method has had outstanding effects on my learning, like a cleared brain and feel more motivated to learn.

I believe that if we all do absolutely nothing more often, we can all become better thinkers.
