# IT5015D-Research-Repository


Projects:

The projects I chose to research are games because I want to have some fun playing a different version of these games, especially when I coded one all by myself and had a huge feeling of accomplishment completing it.
The games that I chose as part of my research includes a number guessing game for the computer or a person to play, Hangman, Three Cup Monte, and my favourite, Wordle.





Do you take regular breaks away from your screen?

Yes I do. I try to get out of my chair every 30 minutes, or an hour if I'm extra busy. There are a few different ways I take breaks, one of them is doing high-knees up to my hips, I do this for 3-5 minutes.


Another way I take breaks, usually after doing high-knees is I stand or lie down and do nothing, and I mean nothing. (That means not going on my phone too.) This is called Niksen, which is a common practice that many Dutch people use while they're at work, or when they are stressed, and here's why I think Niksen is a very simple, but a very powerful way to clear your mind. 

One way I practice Niksen is by going out for a walk on farmland which I live right next to, and then find a place to sit for up to half an hour, and then head back and get stuck into work. Sometimes in our lives, we have moments when we come up with the most creative ideas or find better solutions to problems, whether it'd be in the shower, lying in bed, or feeling bored waiting for something. This has the same effects when you're doing nothing. Even if it's just for five minutes, you might come up with the next big thing, or an idea to solve that problem that's been bugging you for a while. 

Although, some people may argue that this is being lazy and more time could've been spent doing work, but applying this method into my daily life has had outstanding effects on my learning as well as my work too. As a person who often gets distracted for short periods of time, I see this as an oppourtunity to take in everything that I've learned so far, then after a break, I continue with my work with a clear and refreshed mind that's ready to learn again. I strongly believe that if we all simply do absolutely nothing more often, or take more shorter breaks if needed, we can all become better learners.


On a scale on 0-5, how confident are you with each of the assignments?

For the software development area of this course, I felt a 4 for the Flowchart and Pseudocode because it didn't cause a lot of hesitation for me, and I didn't have too much trouble completing it in the end. For the Software Project, I felt a 2 as the deadline for the project approached faster than I anticipated. Despite getting it done on time, I was under pressure for the last two days, which became a huge factor in the confidence decrease. And finally, for the Research Repository, I would easily say a 5. This is because the task involved working with fun projects which came with a lot of determination to keep working and getting it done before the deadline.


How many tabs do you have open in your web browser?

On campus I had an average of 7 tabs open divided between the two screens I use while working on each assignment. The bottom screen has tabs for music, E-mails, OneDrive, and Canvas. The other tabs in the top screen are related to my assignments, like my GitHub Research Repository along with other tabs on researching Python projects and websites to help me with my work. 
I think having seven tabs open is a fair amount, taking into consideration that my computer's performance wasn't heavily effected by the tabs, and I didn't feel overwhelmed thinking that there's so much work that I need to do. When I close a tab I no longer need, I feel like I've crossed one item off of a checklist and feel like I'm making progress, especially once I've finished an assignment completely, I end up closing my entire browser on the top screen.


What is an IDE?

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software application that enables programmers to develop software with programming languages such as Python, C++ and more. With a built-in source code editor, and useful tools and features to increase workflow efficiency, IDE's help streamline the process in writing code. This includes writing, testing and debugging. Some IDE's have a limited amount of progamming languages you can code on, whether it would be for a mobile or desktop application. Some common IDE's include Microsoft Visual Studio, Xcode, Android Studio, Atom and IDLE.
