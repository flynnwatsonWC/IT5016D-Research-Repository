# IT5015D-Research-Repository


Projects:

The projects I chose to research are games because I want to have some fun playing a different version of these games, especially when I coded one all by myself and had a huge feeling of accomplishment completing it.
The games I chose as part of my research includes a number guessing game for the computer or a person to play, Hangman, Three Cup Monte, and my favourite, Wordle.





Do you take regular breaks away from your screen?

Yes I do. I try to get out of my chair every 30 minutes, or an hour if I'm extra busy. There are a few different ways I take breaks, one of them is doing high-knees up to my hips, I do this for 3-5 minutes.


Another way I take breaks, usually after doing high-knees is I stand or lie down doing nothing, and I mean nothing. (That means not going on my phone too.) This is called Niksen, which is a common practice that Dutch people use while they're at work, or when they are stressed, and here's why I think Niksen is a very simple, but powerful way to clear your mind. 

One way I do this is by going a walk on farmland which I live right next to, and then find a place to sit for up to half an hour, then head back and get stuck into work. Sometimes in our lives, we have moments when we come up with the most creative ideas or find alternative solutions to problems, whether it'd be in the shower, lying in bed, or feeling bored waiting on something. This has the same effects while doing nothing. Even if it's just for five minutes, you might come up with the next big thing, or solve that problem that's been bugging you for a while. 

Although, some people may argue that this is being lazy and more time could've been spent doing work, but applying this method into my daily life has had outstanding effects on my learning as well as my work too. As a person who often gets distracted for short periods of time, I see this as an oppourtunity to take in everything that I've learned so far, then after a few minutes I continue with my work with a clear and refreshed mind that's ready to learn again. I strongly believe that if we all simply do absolutely nothing more often, or take more short breaks if needed, we can all become better learners and thinkers.


On a scale on 0-5, how confident are you with each of the assignments?

For the software development area of this course, I felt a 4 for the Flowchart and Pseudocode because it didn't cause a lot of hesitation for me, and I didn't have too much trouble completing it in the end. For the Software Project, I felt a 2 as the deadline for the project approached faster than I anticipated, despite getting it done on time. I was under pressure for the last two days, which became a huge factor in the confidence decrease. And finally, for the Research Repository, I would easily say a 5. This is because the task involved working with fun projects which came with a lot of determination to work and get it done before the deadline.


How many tabs do you have open in your web browser?

On campus I had an average of 7 tabs open divided between the two screens and browsers I use. The bottom screen is used for toggling between music, E-mails, OneDrive, and Canvas. The other tabs in the top screen are related to assessments. An example for this assessment, I had my GitHub Research Repository open, along with other tabs on researching Python projects.


What is an IDE?

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software application that enables programmers to develop software with programming languages such as Python, C++ or others. With a built-in source code editor and useful tools and features to increase workflow efficiency, IDE's help to streamline the coding process, including writing, testing and debugging.
