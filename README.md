# IT5015D-Research-Repository


Projects:

The projects I chose to research are games because I want to have some fun playing a different version of these games, especially when I coded one all by myself and had a huge feeling of accomplishment completing it.
The games I chose as part of my research includes a number guessing game for the computer or a person to play, Hangman, Three Cup Monte, and my favourite, Wordle.





Do you take regular breaks away from your screen?

Yes I do. I try to get out of my chair every 30 minutes, or an hour if I'm extra busy. There are a few different ways I take breaks, one of them is doing high-knees up to my hips, I do this for 3-5 minutes.


Another way I take breaks, usually after doing high-knees is I stand or lie down doing nothing, and I mean nothing. (That means not going on my phone too.) This is called Niksen, which is a common practice that Dutch people use while they're at work, or when they are stressed, and here's why I think Niksen is a very simple, but powerful way to clear your mind. 

One way I do this is by going a walk on farmland which I live right next to, and then find a place to sit for up to half an hour, then head back and get stuck into work. Sometimes in our lives, we have moments when we come up with the most creative ideas or find alternative solutions to problems, whether it'd be in the shower, lying in bed, or feeling bored waiting on something. This has the same effects while doing nothing. Even if it's just for five minutes, you might come up with the next big thing, or solve that problem that's been bugging you for a while. 

Although, some people may argue that this is being lazy and more time could've been spent doing work, but applying this method into my daily life has had outstanding effects on my learning as well as my work too. As a person who often gets distracted for short periods of time, I see this as an oppourtunity to take in everything that I've learned so far, then after a few minutes I continue with my work with a clear and refreshed mind that's ready to learn again. I strongly believe that if we all simply do absolutely nothing more often, or take more short breaks if needed, we can all become better learners and thinkers.
